We worked with the spotify dataset since we were interested in a musical dataset. The spotify dataset we found had a rich feature set which was relatable and sufficient for data analysis.

Goals:
Our goals were to have good visualization queries and interact with the data to display valuable and important information .

Rationale:


Overview of development:
  -> We first cleaned the data set (Jaideep)
  -> Then we explored the data and decided to ask questions based on observed features and data (Jaideep and Keertana)
  -> We then queried the dataset for the columns we needed (Jaideep)
  -> We then built interactive data elements in streamlit (Keertana)
